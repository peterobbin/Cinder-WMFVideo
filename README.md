# Installation
- Make sure you have an up to date video driver.  WGL_NV_DX_interop behaves poorly with older drivers.
- After copying/cloning this repo to your Cinder blocks folder, use Tinderbox to create a new project and select to use the Cinder-WMFVideo block as either reference or copy.
- If you see an error about missing `atlcomcli.h`. Make sure you have C++ ATL installed for your current build tools in Visual Studio. 

# Use
The ciWMFVideoPlayer class can be used very similarly to qtime::MovieGl.  To load a video, pass a path to the video you want to load to ciWMFVideoPlayer::load.  Videos can be stopped, looped, paused and the current position of the playhead in the video can be retrieved or set.  Currently drawing videos to screen is a bit different than qtime::MovieGl in that you will have to call the ciWMFVideoPlayer::draw method with a screen position and width/height.
